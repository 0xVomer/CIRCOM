# &#8505; Important deprecation note

The old `circom` compiler written in Javascript will be frozen, but it can still be downloaded from the [old circom repository](https://github.com/iden3/circom_old).

# About circom 

Current `circom` is a compiler written in Rust for compiling circuits written in the `circom` language.
The compiler outputs the representation of the circuit as constraints and produces everything needed to compute different ZK proofs. The documentation for installing and using `circom` and its associated tools can be found at [doc](http://docs.circom.io).
