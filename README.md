`circom` is a compiler written in Rust for compiling circuits written in the `circom` language.
The compiler outputs the representation of the circuit as constraints and everything needed to compute different ZK proofs.

The old compiler writen in Javascript will be frozen and can still be downloaded from https://github.com/iden3/circom_old.
